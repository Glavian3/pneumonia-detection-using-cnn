# Pneumonia Detection using CNN
This repository contains code for pneumonia detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images labeled as either normal or having pneumonia.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the model can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. It contains a total of 5,863 X-ray images, including 1,387 normal images and 4,476 pneumonia images.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
You can install the required packages by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Model Architecture
The model architecture used in this project consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers and a softmax activation function.

# Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set. More details about the results can be found in the project report.
